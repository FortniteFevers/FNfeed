FeversBR is a utility which generates the current Fortnite News Updates and shares it on Twitter with a caption of the body and title.

## Usage

Open ```bot.py``` in a prefered text editor, and enter your twitter api keys where needed. You can get api keys [here.](https://developer.twitter.com)
You can also edit the delay time if needed. The reccomended time is ```5 seconds```


```
MAKE SURE YOU ADD A FOLDER WITHIN THE MASTER FOLDER TITLED "NewsImages"!!
If you do not do this, the bot WILL NOT work.

This program does not need to be ran using a scheduler, as it runs in the background and checks every 5 seconds for the news feed.
